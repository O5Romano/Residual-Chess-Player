# Residual-Chess-Player
A simple 'chess player' that tries to imitate Stockfish's predictions. Unfortunately, I don't think training it on a large scale is feasible at the moment, so I can't guarantee it won't overfit easily. Maybe adding some variety from time to time or replacing the fc with global average pooling could help.
NOTE: You must download Stockfish on your local machine
